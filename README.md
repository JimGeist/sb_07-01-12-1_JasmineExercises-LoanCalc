## Assignment Details
# Part One - Loan Calculator
Assignment involved creating Jasmine tests to test the calculateMonthlyPayment function. 

For unknown reasons, the test html for the exercise in calculator-test.html did not include any of the calculator html elements. A new html was created and called index.html which includes both the necessary includes for Jasmine tests but also the html elements for the calculator.
